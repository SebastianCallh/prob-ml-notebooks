# Probabilistic inference with Gaussian distributions
Inspired by the lecture series of [Probabilistic Machine Learning by Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1tHaOFY96m5uX3J21a6yNd) I wanted to jot some of the ideas down. The result is a collection of [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks on probabilistic machine learning using Gaussian distributions.
The notebooks covers the fundamental properties of the Gaussian distribution, and how they let us construct probabilistic machine learning models over functions.

### Running Pluto notebooks
The Pluto notebooks require Julia to be run. You can run `julia run.jl` which will activate a local environment, make sure the necessary dependencies are available, and start the Pluto server.
